# Bug Fixes and Improvements Summary

## âœ… **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **Investment Highlights - Authentication-Based Routing**
- **Problem**: "Invest Now" button redirected directly to user investment page without checking authentication
- **Solution**: 
  - Converted `InvestmentHighlights` to a client component with server wrapper
  - Added authentication check using `useCurrentUser()` hook
  - Redirects to login page with `redirectTo` parameter if user not authenticated
  - Redirects to user investment page if user is authenticated

**Files Modified:**
- `components/InvestmentHighlights.tsx` - Added client-side authentication handling
- `app/page.tsx` - Updated to use `InvestmentHighlightsWrapper`

### 2. **Public Project Details Page - Dynamic SEO with OG Images**
- **Problem**: Public project pages lacked proper SEO and social media sharing capabilities
- **Solution**:
  - Added `generateMetadata` function for dynamic SEO
  - **Open Graph** tags with project cover image as OG image
  - **Twitter Card** support with large image preview
  - Dynamic meta description with project details (ROI, location, price)
  - **Keywords** based on project category, location, and features
  - **Structured Data** for better search engine indexing

**SEO Features Added:**
- Dynamic title: `"${project.title} | StableBricks Investment Opportunity"`
- Rich description with ROI, location, and pricing
- Cover image as social media preview image
- Additional project images as alternate OG images
- Twitter card with large image preview
- Canonical URL for SEO
- Proper robots meta tags

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(public)/projects/[slug]/page.tsx` - Added complete SEO metadata

### 3. **Authentication-Based Investment Button on Public Pages**
- **Problem**: Public project pages had direct links to protected investment pages
- **Solution**:
  - Created `InvestmentButton` client component
  - Added authentication check before redirecting
  - Redirects to login with `redirectTo` parameter if not authenticated
  - Seamless redirect to investment page after login

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(public)/projects/[slug]/components/InvestmentButton.tsx` - New component
- `app/(public)/projects/[slug]/page.tsx` - Updated to use new component

### 4. **Login Redirect Functionality**
- **Problem**: Login page didn't support redirecting users to their intended destination after login
- **Solution**:
  - Added `redirectTo` parameter support in login form
  - Updated login action to accept and use redirect parameter
  - Google OAuth also uses custom redirect URL
  - Maintains intended destination across login flow

**Files Modified:**
- `components/auth/LogInForm.tsx` - Added redirectTo handling
- `actions/login.ts` - Added redirectTo parameter support

### 5. **View Details Button Routing**
- **Problem**: None - this was already working correctly
- **Status**: âœ… Already routes to `/projects/[slug]` (public project details page)

## ðŸš€ **Technical Improvements:**

### **SEO Enhancements:**
- Dynamic OG images mapped to project cover images
- Rich snippets with investment details
- Social media sharing optimization
